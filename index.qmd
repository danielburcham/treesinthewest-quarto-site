### Event Overview

Throughout history, trees have been used to make life more comfortable
for people living in towns and cities, and we are still discovering
all the ways trees improve people's lives today.

In the Western US, trees and forests do not naturally thrive in most areas, 
and the canopy shading most communities instead shows people's
deep and longstanding affinity for trees. But communities in the West
also face unique challenges for growing trees, including limited water
and volatile weather, and many are concerned about the future of urban
forests amid climate shifts and other concerning trends.

At Trees in the West, we explore ways to sustain trees and communities
by learning widely from many different people and sources of knowledge.
Residents, practitioners, policymakers, scientists, and others take part
in conversations about important issues for urban and community forests
in a region with exceptional natural and cultural heritages.

### 2025 Focus: Climate Change Adaptation

Each year, we will explore a prominent theme in urban forestry. This
year's sessions will explore the role of urban forestry in climate
change adaptation. 

#### Continuing education credits available for ISA credential holders
Certified Arborists, Municipal Specialists, and Board Certified Master Arborists will be eligible for CEUs (details coming soon).
