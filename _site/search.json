Yet, predicting which tree species we should select, grow, plant and maintain is challenging, particularly in the hot and dry Western US. We need to find innovative long-term solutions so our urban forests can thrive – not survive – under new climatic, environmental and social stressors.\nThis talk will present an integrated framework to measure, predict and validate the suitability of old and new tree species for planting at various locations. By integrating diverse data streams from field trials, glasshouse experiments, global occurrence records, urban forest inventories, geospatial datasets and plant ecological traits we aim to advance new ideas and approaches to future-proof biodiverse urban forests for decades to come.\nThe science and practice of urban forestry have the unprecedented challenge and unique opportunity to start building stronger futures for our people and our trees. This talk hopes to inspire transforming tree predictions into green realities.\n\n\n\n\n5. 11:05\n\n\nTree Canopy, Heat, and Household Water Use\n\n6. 12:05\n\n\nLunch\n\n7. 12:55\n\n\nResearch Grove Tour\n\n8. 2:10\n\n\nAfternoon Break\n\n9. 2:30\n\n\nDialgoue\n\n10. 3:45\n\n\nClosing Remarks"

    "text": "A panoramic gathering for urban and community forestry\nJoin us for a one-day conference exploring complex and shared sustainability challenges for urban forests in the Western US from diverse perspectives. Connect with your colleagues, learn from experts, and share your insights!\n\nSave the date\nTuesday, May 20, 2025\n8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m.\nCSU Spur, Denver\n\n\nEvent Overview\nThroughout history, trees have been used to make life more comfortable for people living in towns and cities, and we are still discovering all the ways trees improve people’s lives today.\nIn the Western US, trees and forests do not naturally thrive in most areas, and the canopy shading most communities instead shows people’s deep and longstanding affinity for trees. But communities in the West also face unique challenges for growing trees, including limited water and volatile weather, and many are concerned about the future of urban forests amid climate shifts and other concerning trends.\nAt Trees in the West, we explore ways to sustain trees and communities by learning widely from many different people and sources of knowledge. Residents, practitioners, policymakers, scientists, and others take part in conversations about important issues for urban and community forests in a region with exceptional natural and cultural heritages.\n\n\n2025 Focus: Climate Change Adaptation\nEach year, we will explore a prominent theme in urban forestry. This year’s sessions will explore the role of urban forestry in climate change adaptation.\n\nContinuing education credits available for ISA credential holders\nCertified Arborists, Municipal Specialists, and Board Certified Master Arborists will be eligible for CEUs (details coming soon)."
