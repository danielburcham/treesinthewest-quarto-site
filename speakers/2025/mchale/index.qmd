Dr. Melissa McHale is an Associate Professor of Urban Ecology and
Sustainability in the Department of Forest Resources Management at the
University of British Columbia. She leads an internationally recognized
research program that bridges urban theory with applied science to
inform decision-making in cities. With a background in exploring the
social and biophysical drivers of urban ecosystem structure and
function, global urbanization processes, green infrastructure, and
ecosystem service tradeoffs, Dr. McHale brings a systems-based approach
to urban forestry research, emphasizing the connections between
landscape patterns, human health, and well-being. Her current work
focuses on nature-based solutions (NBS) for mitigating urban heat,
assessing the role of tree canopy in semi-arid environments, and
understanding the complex interactions between urban forests, water use,
and thermal comfort. Dr. McHale’s research has revealed critical
insights into the human-relevant thermal benefits of urban forests and
the nuanced role of canopy cover in residential landscapes and
transportation corridors.

Dr. McHale is also deeply committed to fostering partnerships between
cities, universities, and industry. Through recent collaborations in
Canada’s Okanagan region, she has demonstrated how these partnerships
not only address cutting-edge research questions but also enable the
practical application of innovative tools. These efforts help cities
advance their practices at reduced costs, showcasing how co-produced
knowledge can drive meaningful change during times of financial
constraint. Dr. McHale has served as a science advisor to several
organizations, including the Science and Research Committee for Denver’s
Sustainability Advisory Council and the United States Forest Service’s
Denver Urban Field Station, and her work continues to empower
communities across North America to confront shared sustainability
challenges.
